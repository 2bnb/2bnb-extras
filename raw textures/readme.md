# Exporting the Textures
If you're running Photoshop, the "Artboard to Files" export option doesn't give you the option to put a suffix on the end of the file names that you're exporting. 

So, copy and replace the two files in this directory, into your Photoshop install directory under `Adobe Photoshop CC 2017\Presets\Scripts`:
- `ArtboardExport.inc`
- `ArtBoards To Files.jsx`

Once you've done this, you'll get a "Suffix" option as well as the "Prefix" option you have. With this, you can now use the actions that come alongside the appropriate files to make the actual exports. Each Actions export is specific to the photoshop file in the same folder, and need to be imported before being able to make a full export.
